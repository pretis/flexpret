/**
 * The finite state machine (fsm) is designed with four states: EXPECT_DELIM, 
 * EXPECT_FD, and EXPECT_DATA. The "protocol" between the CPU and the
 * emulator is as follows:
 * 
 * 1. The CPU transmits a delimiter (in this case, 0xFFFFFFFF)
 * 2. The CPU transmits the file descriptor it is printing to
 * 3. The CPU transmits a delimiter
 *      while bytes received < length of data:
 *          6a. The CPU transmits one word of data
 *          6b. The CPU transmits a delimiter
 * 
 * The state transitions associated with one message are:
 * 
 * EXCEPT_DELIM -> EXPECT_FD   -> EXPECT_DELIM -> EXPECT_DATA ->
 * EXPECT_DELIM -> EXPECT_DATA -> EXPECT_DELIM -> EXPECT_DATA -> ...
 * EXPECT_DELIM
 * 
 * Where the transitions between EXPECT_DATA -> EXPECT_DELIM -> EXPECT_DATA
 * can occur as many times as there are word inbound.
 * 
 * If for some reason more data needs to be sent before the payload data comes,
 * it should be quite easy to add another state.
