/**
 * About the NOP instructions:
 * 
 * The Wishbone bus needs two clock cycles between subsequenct read/write operations.
 * When the program is optimized with -Os, it will not adhere to this constraint.
 * Therefore we need to insert NOP instructions.
 * 
 * Note that the NOP instructions are not necessary in many cases. E.g., if 
 * the -O0 flag is passed, or if multiple hardware threads are running. Here we
 * assume the worst case to ensure it always works.
 * 
 * The while loops do not need any NOP instructions, because they compile to
 * a load followed by a branch instruction. Loads always an extra cycle.
