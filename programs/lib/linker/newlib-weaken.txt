# These newlib functions are sometimes called by newlib's other functions, such
# as signal(). The problem with this is that they are not aware of the custom
# tinyalloc module, meaning they could overwrite its internal state and cause
# weird bugs.
#
# The solution is to weaken these symbols, which is done using 
# OBJCOPY --weaken-symbols=<filepath>, and provide our custom implementations
# of the functions. 
#
# Weakly defined symbols (in this case, functions) are overwritten by
# non-weak symbols by the linker.
