/**

 * @brief A simple client that can be used with the emulator when the --client
 * option is given to the emulator. It sets up two pin events that the emulator
 * will use to set the pin high and then low again immediately after. This could
 * be used to emulate receiving an external interrupt.
 * 
 * One interrupt is triggered for each character given to stdin. The user could
 * have both the emulator and this client running in two terminals and see
 * how the emulated FlexPRET reacts to getting interrupts.
 * 
 * The simplest way to transmit just one intterrupt is just to press <enter>.
