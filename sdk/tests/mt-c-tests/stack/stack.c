/**
 * @file stack.c
 * @author Magnus MÃ¦hlum (magnmaeh@stud.ntnu.no)
 * @brief This file tests the stack protection feature, which is enabled by passing
 * -fstack-protector<-all> to the compiler. The stack protector essentially 
 * pushes a value onto the stack at the beginning of a function and pops it 
 * at the end of the function. If the value is different, the __stack_chk_fail()
 * function is called.
 * 
 * This test aims to trigger the stack guard in several ways:
 *  1. By directly changing the variable during a function call.
 *  2. By allocating a huge variable on the stack (triggers a compile-time error).
 *     Had it not been for the compile-time error, it would overflow the stack.
 *
