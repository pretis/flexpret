# This script should not be run, it should be sourced by the generated fpga-app.sh.in
# It sets the `interface_cmd` variable to one that uses `picocom`
# If the user prefers other programs for interfacing, they can use e.g., `screen.source`

# This file assumes the variables

# `baudrate`
# are set before sourced.
