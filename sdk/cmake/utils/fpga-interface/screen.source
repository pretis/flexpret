# This script should not be run, it should be sourced by the generated fpga-app.sh.in
# It sets the `interface_cmd` variable to one that uses `screen`
# If the user prefers other programs for interfacing, they can use e.g., `picocom.source`
#
# This file assumes the variables 
# `flashdev`
# `baudrate`
# are set before sourced.
