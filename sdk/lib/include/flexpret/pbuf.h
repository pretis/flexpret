 * @brief A printbuffer API so any thread can write to the Wishbone UART. 
 *        The UART is only accessible by tid = 0, so the printbuffer
 *        basically implements a method to transmit strings from one
 *        tid to another.
 * 
 *        Use pump to transmit strings and drain to receive the strings.
