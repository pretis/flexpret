FlexPRET
================================================================================
__FlexPRET__ is a 5-stage, fine-grained multithreaded [RISC-V](http://riscv.org) processor designed specifically for _mixed-criticality (real-time embedded) systems_ and written in [Chisel](http://www.chisel-lang.org). A hardware thread scheduler decides which hardware thread to start executing each cycle, regulated by configuration and status registers. Each hardware thread is either classified as a _hard real-time thread (HRTT)_ or _soft real-time thread (SRTT)_: HRTTs are only scheduled at a constant rate for _hardware-based isolation and predictability_ (enabling independent formal verification), and SRTTs share remaining cycles (including when a HRTT doesn't need prescribed cycles) for _efficient processor utilization_. For comparison purposes, both single-threaded and round-robin multithreaded 5-stage RISC-V processors can also be generated. FlexPRET was developed at UC Berkeley as part of the [PRET](http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pret/) project.

Note: the porting is not complete for the privileged RISC-V 2.0 ISA, so some tests are disabled.

# Quickstart

To build a default configuration and generate Verilog, run:

```
make fpga
```

# Unit tests
To run all unit tests:

```
mill flexpret.test
```

To run a specific unit test (e.g. SimpleCoreTest):

```
mill flexpret.test.testOnly flexpret.core.test.SimpleCoreTest
```

Unit tests are found under `src/test/scala/core/`.

# Simulation

If you would like to execute your own programs you will still need to [install the RISC-V compiler](#risc-v-compiler) (in particular, `riscv32-unknown-elf-*`), and have `verilator` installed.
Note that a modern version of Verilator is required (e.g. Verilator 4.038+).

To build the simulator, run:

```
make emulator
```

See the instructions printed after running the above, or read them in `emulator/emulator.mk` on how to use the simulator.

To run a basic Fibonnaci example in simulation, run:

```
cd programs/tests/c-tests/fib/

# Compile the program
../../../../scripts/c/riscv_build.sh fib fib.c

# Run the simulation
../../../../emulator/fp-emu +ispm=fib.hex
```

We recommend adding `scripts/c/` and `emulator/` to PATH so that `riscv_build.sh` and `fp-emu` become directly accessible.

# Directory Structure
- `build/` Temporary folder used as part of the build
- `fpga/` Generated Verilog code and scripts for FPGA deployment
- `programs/` C and assembly programs and test suites
  - `lib/` Libraries, linker scripts, and startup scripts
  - `tests/` C test cases
- `scripts/` Various scripts
  - `c/` Scripts for compiling C programs
  - `hdl/` Scripts for processing HDL programs
  - `fpga/` Scripts for configuring programs on an FPGA
- `src/main/scala/` RTL source files
  - `Core/` FlexPRET processor (and baseline processors) in Chisel
  - `uart/` Verilog code for UART
- `src/test/scala/` Unit tests
- `test/` Unit testing scripts

# Makefile Configuration

Change configuration in `config.mk` or by providing argument to make:

### FlexPRET Configuration

- `THREADS=[1-8]` Specify number of hardware threads
- `FLEXPRET=[true/false]` Use flexible thread scheduling
- `ISPM_KBYTES=[]` Size of instruction scratchpad memory (32 bit words)
- `DSPM_KBYTES=[]` Size of instruction scratchpad memory (32 bit words)
- `SUFFIX=[min,ex,ti,all]`
    - `min`: base RV32I
    - `ex`: `min` + exceptions (necessary)
    - `ti`: `ex` + timing instructions
    - `all`: `ti` + all exception causes and stats

Not all combinations are valid.

### Target Configuration
- `TARGET=[emulator/fpga]` Select default target
- `DEBUG=[true/false]` Generate waveform dump.

### RISC-V Compiler
We use the Newlib installation of the [RISC-V GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain).

To install the 32-bit version of the GCC compiler (Newlib):
1. Clone and `cd` into the `riscv-gnu-toolchain` repository;
2. Install the necessary [prerequisites](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain#prerequisites);
3. Run `./configure --prefix=/opt/riscv --with-arch=rv32i --with-abi=ilp32` (assuming your preferred installation directory is `/opt/riscv`);
4. Run `make`.

### Program Configuration
- `PROG_DIR=[path]` Directory of programs in tests/ to compile and/or run. This is the test program that is executed when running command 'make run'. The default value 'isa' means that an assembler test suite is executed.
- `PROG_CONFIG=[]` Program configuration, start with target name

### Regression Test
To run a C regression test for the current processor configurations
```
cd programs/tests/
make run-c-tests
```

# Chisel
We use Chisel version 3.4 via mill.
