Under Development
================================================================================
This branch (riscv-2.0) is a snapshot of development efforts to update FlexPRET for changes to the RISC-V specification. The porting is not complete for the privileged RISC-V ISA, so some tests are disabled.

`make run` should compile the ISA test suite and run it on the C++ emulator generated by Chisel if the [correct version of the RISC-V compiler](#risc-v-compiler) is installed.

FlexPRET
================================================================================
__FlexPRET__ is a 5-stage, fine-grained multithreaded [RISC-V*](http://riscv.org) processor designed specifically for _mixed-criticality (real-time embedded) systems_ and written in [Chisel**](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/). A hardware thread scheduler decides which hardware thread to start executing each cycle, regulated by configuration and status registers. Each hardware thread is either classified as a _hard real-time thread (HRTT)_ or _soft real-time thread (SRTT)_: HRTTs are only scheduled at a constant rate for _hardware-based isolation and predictability_ (enabling independent formal verification), and SRTTs share remaining cycles (including when a HRTT doesn't need prescribed cycles) for _efficient processor utilization_. For comparison purposes, both single-threaded and round-robin multithreaded 5-stage RISC-V processors can also be generated. FlexPRET is developed at UC Berkeley as part of the [PRET](http://chess.eecs.berkeley.edu/pret/) project.

Quickstart
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build a default configuration and generate Verilog, run:

```
make fpga
```

TODO(edwardw): fix the simulator workflow

If you would like to execute your own programs you will still need to [install the RISC-V compiler](#risc-v-compiler) and have `java` and `g++` installed.

To run RTL tests:

```
mill flexpret.test
```

To simulate an assembly code test suite (first run may take a few minutes to download dependencies):
```
make run
```

This will simulate the execution of the program directory `tests/isa` on FlexPRET configured with 4 hardware threads. The default configuration is set in `config.mk` and can be [changed](#flexpret-configuration). The makefile will (if needed) install [mill](http://www.lihaoyi.com/mill/), download Chisel, generate a C++ emulator for the FlexPRET processor, compile the C++ emulator, excute the C++ emulator on each program in the test suite, and finally display the results.

See the [tests](#tests) section for information about running other programs.

`make clean` will remove files associated with current configuration and `make cleanll` will remove files associated with all configurations.

Directory Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- `src/main/scala/` Chisel and Verilog source files
  - `Core/` FlexPRET processor (and baseline processors) in Chisel
  - `uart/` Verilog code for UART
- `src/test/scala/` Unit tests
- `test/` Unit testing scripts

(Outdated)
- `emulator/` C++ emulator and testbench for generated processors
- `fpga/` Generated Verilog code and scripts for FPGA deployment
- `scripts/` Various scripts
- `tests/` C and assembly programs and test suites
  - `include/` Libraries and macros


Makefile Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Change configuration in `config.mk` or by providing argument to make:

### FlexPRET Configuration
- `THREADS=[1-8]` Specify number of hardware threads
- `FLEXPRET=[true/false]` Use flexible thread scheduling
- `ISPM_KBYTES=[]` Size of instruction scratchpad memory (32 bit words)
- `DSPM_KBYTES=[]` Size of instruction scratchpad memory (32 bit words)
- `SUFFIX=[min,ex,ti,all]`
    - `min`: base RV32I
    - `ex`: `min` + exceptions (necessary)
    - `ti`: `ex` + timing instructions
    - `all`: `ti` + all exception causes and stats

Not all combinations are valid.

### Target Configuration
- `TARGET=[emulator/fpga]` Select default target
- `DEBUG=[true/false]` Generate waveform dump.

### Program Configuration
- `PROG_DIR=[path]` Directory of programs in tests/ to compile and/or run. This is the test program that is executed when running command 'make run'. The default value 'isa' means that an assembler test suite is executed.
- `PROG_CONFIG=[]` Program configuration, start with target name

### Regression Test
To run a regression test for many processor configurations
```
./run-tests.py
```

Tests
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`PROG_DIR` needs to be modified to execute different programs on the emulator (e.g. `PROG_DIR=simple-mc`)

`tests/simple-mc`: A simple mixed-criticality example with 4 periodic tasks to demonstrate differences between hard real-time threads (HRTTs) and soft real-time threads (SRTTs) ([More info](tests/simple-mc/README.md))  
`tests/complex-mc`: A complex mixed-criticality example with 21 periodic tasks on 8 hardware threads to demonstrate a methodology for task mapping and thread scheduling ([More info](tests/complex-mc/README.md))  
`tests/dev/*`: Programs that are out-of-date, unsupported, or under development  

RISC-V Compiler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use the RISC-V GCC compiler, see [riscv.org](http://riscv.org/) for more information.

RISC-V toolchain version this branch is developed against:
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain/commit/9a8a0aa98571c97291702e2e283fc1056f3ce2e2

A docker image with the compiler version installed can be created by using or modifying `docker/Dockerfile`.

Program Compilation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile new programs, create a directory in `tests/` and a `test.mk` file within that directory. Within `test.mk`, define `PROG` with the names of the source C (also do `define C=1`) or assembly files, then add `$(DEFAULT_RULES)` at the botton. This will generate default compilation rules for the source files (located in `tests/tests.mk`).

To use timing instructions or other FlexPRET-specific constructs, look at files
within `tests/include`. Look at other files within `tests/` for reference.

Chisel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use Chisel version 3.4 via mill.

To learn more about Chisel, visit its [website](http://www.chisel-lang.org/) and particularly the [documentation section](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/documentation.html).

C++ Emulator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chisel will generate a C++ emulator for cycle-accurate behavior of the hardware design. A testbench is compiled with this emulator to simulate program execution. The testbench takes the following arguments:
- `--maxcycles=X` number of clock cycles to simulate
- `--ispm=X` location of initial instruction memory contents (each line 32-bit hex value)
- `--dspm=X` location of initial data memory contents (each line 32-bit hex value)
- `--vcd=X` (optional) location of vcd file to create
- `--vcdstart=X` (optional) cycle to start vcd creation (default is 0)

FPGA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FlexPRET has been evaluated on both a Xilinx Virtex-5 and Spartan-6 FPGA.
