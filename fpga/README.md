# FPGA

FlexPRET may be run on an FPGA.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

### Hardware setup

### LED example

Run the example located in `./zedboard/leds` to verify that the setup is correct.

### Blinky example

Run the example located in `./zedboard/fp-blinky`. This example runs blinky using the FlexPRET CPU and verifies that software can run on the FPGA.
